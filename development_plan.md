```

## Phase 3: Backend Core Implementation
- [ ] Create FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Implement Pydantic models for file operations
- [ ] Set up SQLAlchemy database models and connection
- [ ] Create database initialization and migration scripts

### File Structure to Create:
```
app/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py (move from root)
├── config.py
├── database.py
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── file.py
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── files.py
└── services/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── ipfs.py
    └── database.py
```

## Phase 4: IPFS Integration
- [ ] Implement IPFS service layer
- [ ] Create file upload functionality to IPFS
- [ ] Implement file retrieval from IPFS by CID
- [ ] Add file metadata extraction and storage
- [ ] Handle IPFS connection errors and retries

### Key Components:
- IPFS client initialization and configuration
- File upload with progress tracking
- Content addressing and CID generation
- File pinning for persistence
- Error handling for network issues

## Phase 5: API Development
- [ ] Implement file upload endpoint (`POST /api/files/upload`)
- [ ] Create file retrieval endpoint (`GET /api/files/{cid}`)
- [ ] Build file listing endpoint (`GET /api/files/`)
- [ ] Add file deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/files/{cid}`)
- [ ] Implement file info endpoint (`GET /api/files/{cid}/info`)
- [ ] Create search endpoint (`POST /api/files/search`)

### API Features:
- Request/response validation with Pydantic
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- File upload progress and streaming
- Pagination for file listings
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Phase 6: Database Layer
- [ ] Create SQLite database schema
- [ ] Implement file metadata models
- [ ] Add database CRUD operations
- [ ] Create database connection pooling
- [ ] Implement search and indexing

### Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    content_type TEXT,
    size INTEGER,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSON
);
```

## Phase 7: Web Interface Development
- [ ] Create HTML template for file management
- [ ] Implement CSS styling with modern design
- [ ] Add JavaScript for file operations
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop upload interface
- [ ] Build file browser and preview functionality

### UI Components:
- File upload area with drag-and-drop
- File list with thumbnails and metadata
- Search and filter controls
- File preview modal
- Progress indicators for uploads
- Responsive design for mobile

## Phase 8: Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for IPFS service
- [ ] Create API endpoint tests
- [ ] Add database operation tests
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Set up test fixtures and mock data

### Test Coverage:
- IPFS connectivity and operations
- API endpoint functionality
- Database CRUD operations
- File upload/download workflows
- Error handling scenarios

## Phase 9: Security & Authentication (Optional)
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Add user registration and login
- [ ] Create role-based access control
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement file access permissions

## Phase 10: Deployment & Production
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Set up docker-compose for multi-service deployment
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy (nginx)
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create deployment scripts

### Production Considerations:
- PostgreSQL migration for better performance
- IPFS cluster setup for redundancy
- SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Functionality (Week 1-2)
- Working FastAPI application
- IPFS integration for file upload/download
- Basic web interface
- SQLite database with metadata storage

### Milestone 2: Full Feature Set (Week 3-4)
- Complete API with all endpoints
- Advanced web interface with search
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Documentation and deployment guides

### Milestone 3: Production Ready (Week 5-6)
- Security features implemented
- Production deployment configuration
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **IPFS Connectivity Issues**
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms
   - Test with both local and remote IPFS nodes

2. **File Upload Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement streaming uploads and progress tracking
   - Add file size limits and validation

3. **Database Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Design for easy PostgreSQL migration
   - Implement proper indexing and query optimization

### Development Risks:
1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Use uv for dependency management
   - Pin specific versions in pyproject.toml

2. **IPFS Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple operations and build complexity
   - Reference IPFS documentation and examples

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Successfully upload files to IPFS
- [ ] Retrieve files by CID with proper content types
- [ ] Store and query file metadata
- [ ] Web interface allows full file management
- [ ] API provides all specified endpoints

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Upload files up to 100MB without issues
- [ ] API response times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Web interface works on mobile devices
- [ ] 95% test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage

## Next Immediate Actions:
1. Update pyproject.toml with dependencies
2. Set up IPFS node and test connectivity
3. Create basic FastAPI application structure
4. Implement first API endpoint for file upload
5. Create simple web interface for testing
