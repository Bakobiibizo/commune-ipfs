**Resource Management:**
- ✅ Proper connection handling
- ✅ File size limits enforced
- ✅ Memory-efficient file processing
- ✅ Database connection pooling

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Test Suite** - Create comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Add Test Manifest** - Create tests/test_manifest.md to track testing progress

### Medium Priority
1. **Environment Configuration** - Ensure .env.example covers all configuration options
2. **Production Deployment** - Add Docker configuration and deployment guides
3. **Monitoring** - Enhance metrics collection and monitoring capabilities

### Low Priority
1. **Code Coverage** - Add code coverage reporting
2. **Performance Testing** - Add load testing for file operations
3. **API Documentation** - Consider adding OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## Conclusion

The IPFS Storage System is a well-implemented, production-ready application that successfully meets all specified requirements. The code quality is high, with proper error handling, security measures, and architectural patterns. The only significant gap is the absence of automated tests, which should be addressed before production deployment.
